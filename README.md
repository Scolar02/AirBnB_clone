### Description

This project is intended to build a clone of the AirBnb website. It is a four phase project that involves:

1. A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
2. A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
3. A database or files that store data (data = objects) 
4. An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

In this first phase, the data model is created, functions for managing objects via console and storing and persisting objects to a file(JSON file)

### Environment

The project was developed and tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Ubuntu 22.10.

### CLI
